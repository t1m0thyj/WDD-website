## Submit New Themes

### Create and package your theme

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop/wiki/Creating-custom-themes) to create your own theme. Then package the images and theme.json file into a ZIP archive.

Rename the file to change the `.zip` extension to `.ddw`. The rest of the filename should equal your theme ID.

Make sure your theme meets the following requirements:

- Theme ID must be unique and can only contain alphanumeric, hyphen (`-`), and underscore (`_`) characters
- Theme package must contain theme.json file at top level
- Theme JSON must include required keys (dayImageList, imageCredits, imageFilename, nightImageList)
- Theme package cannot contain extra files in addition to images and theme.json
- Theme package must include all images referenced in theme.json
- Image size must be at least HD resolution (1920x1080)
- Image ratio must be landscape or square (16:9 is recommended)
- Image shown at noon should be brightest image in the set
- Image shown at midnight should be darkest image in the set
- Image credits must include name of the original artist/photographer

### Publish your theme to MediaFire

Upload your DDW file online for others to download and use in WDD. If you want your theme featured on the [WDD Themes site](https://windd.info/themes/), you must upload your theme to MediaFire.

Sign up for a MediaFire account if you don't have one yet. Then log in to upload a file and copy the share link:
